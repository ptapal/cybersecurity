## Introduction
This project focuses on the remote database server of a company, which has been open to the public since its launch three years ago. The server stores critical customer, campaign, and analytic data, making it a prime target for hackers and unauthorized access. This report aims to identify the risks associated with the current access controls of the system and provide recommendations for remediation to ensure the security and integrity of the data.

## Methodology
The assessment was guided by the NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1, which provides a framework for risk analysis of information systems. The scope of the assessment was limited to the current access controls of the system. The risk assessment was conducted using a qualitative approach, where the likelihood and severity of potential threats were evaluated and scored based on their impact on business operations. Remediation strategy, such as implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms, was also provided.

## Conclusion
The vulnerability assessment of the remote database server has identified significant risks to the security and integrity of the data stored on the system. The current access controls in place are inadequate, leaving the system open to unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and alteration of critical data. The implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms, including strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication, is essential to limit user privileges and prevent unauthorized access.
