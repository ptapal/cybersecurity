## Introduction
This project aims to provide a structured approach to investigating potential security incidents and updating employee computers as needed, using SQL queries to extract and analyze relevant data.

## Methodology
The project uses SQL queries to filter and retrieve specific information on login attempts and employee machines. The project includes queries that use the following techniques: filtering for specific time periods, specific countries or departments; using operators to combine filters and wildcards to filter for patterns.

## Files and Structure

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to investigate potential security incidents and update employee computers as needed. The project includes queries for retrieving after hours failed login attempts, login attempts on specific dates, login attempts outside of a specific country, and employee machines from specific departments or buildings.
