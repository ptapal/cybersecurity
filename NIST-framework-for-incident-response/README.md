## Introduction
This incident response report is based on a scenario where a multimedia company experienced a DDoS attack, compromising the internal network for two hours. The report uses the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to analyze the incident and develop a plan to improve the company's network security.

## Provided Documents
Two documents were provided:
- **scenario**
- **Applying the NIST CSF**

## Methodology
The report was created using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, which consists of five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. Each function was applied to the incident scenario to identify areas for improvement in the company's network security.

## Files and Structure
- `Applying the NIST CSF .docx`: provided supporting material on how to apply NIST framework
- `scenario.docx`: provided scenario
- `Incident report analysis.docx`: completed incident response report

## Usage Instructions
To navigate the repository, review the files listed above. Each file correcponds to a specific part of the analysis.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to a real-world scenario. The incident response report provides a comprehensive analysis of the incident and recommendations for improving network security.
